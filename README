I managed to build a clapack shared library for J, which includes the blas, 
so there are no dependencies for end users. It assumes you have libm and 
that's it. The CBLAS and F2Clib dependencies have been manually added
to the library.

Please excuse the Makefile mess; it was a quick hack. When linux migrates 
to modern versions of lapack (3.4 and above), the j-lapacke build might be 
preferred. Meanwhile, this can help people now.

To use: drop the shared library lapack64.so and lapack.ijs file in your 
addons/math/lapack directory. 

If you can't get F2C on your system for somereason, you should be able 
to add those objects to the shared library in the same manner.
