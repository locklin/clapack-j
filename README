I managed to build a clapack shared library for J, which includes the blas, so there are no
dependencies for end users. It assumes you have F2C, libm and that's it.

Please excuse the Makefile mess; it was a quick hack. When linux migrates to modern versions
of lapack (3.4 and above), the j-lapacke build might be preferred. Meanwhile, this can help
people now.
